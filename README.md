# line-counter
 A simple C# program to count the number of lines in your code project.

**This is the Windows version, if you're using Linux then please use [this](https://github.com/prokenz101/line-counter/tree/linux-x64).**

<br />

## Install

There are two versions of this program, the `framework-dependent` version and the `self-contained` version.

If you have the .NET 6 Runtime, you may use the framework-dependent version.

And if you don't, then either get the runtime, or use the self-contained version.

Both of them may be found [here](https://github.com/prokenz101/line-counter/releases/latest).

<br />

## Use

Now, once you've downloaded the program, cut it and paste it into your code project's folder.

Once the .exe file is in your code project, you may execute it in a terminal.

You must specify the file extensions for it to know what files to count lines for (like .py or .cs or .js)

Example:

```bash
line-counter .py
```

The above command will make the program calculate the number of lines in every python file (in the current directory and all its children).

### Bugs?
Too bad.

Code this program yourself in whatever language you want if you don't want bugs.
